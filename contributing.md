### Contributing

[Paul Bouwer has written an excellent guide for contributors](http://blog.paulbouwer.com/2010/12/27/git-github-and-an-open-source-net-project-introduction/) starting from scratch (no previous Git knowledge required).  
In a nutshell:

 * Don't worry about code formatting, styles, etc.
 * Tests are a must. Without tests, changes will not be merged, except for very specific cases.
 * Whenever possible, favor immutable classes and pure code.
 * If you're adding a new feature or making a breaking change, update the corresponding documentation.
 * SolrNet has recently adopted using [Gitflow workflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) as its branching strategy, whenever you contribute please from your fork create a pull request with a branch that is up to date. Once confirmed, it will be merged and a new version will be released.
